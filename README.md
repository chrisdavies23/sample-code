sample-code
===========

A repository for samples of the code I have written be it php, javascript or what ever.
Feel free to browse my code and/or suggest any ways for improvement. thank you for your time.

solarPanelTariff.htm is a javascript/html application which allows a user to select from
drop down listboxes, a number of predefined values, namely, direction of roof, tilt angle
of roof, amount of shade and number of panels. On clicking the calculate button the user is
given the amount of savings the user could expect. The code is based on an industry based
algorithm which is available to view in the configurator.mht file.

dateSearch.php is a rather quick and dirty method I've written to allow the input and retrieval
of British formatted dates via php and MySQL. dateSearch and dateForm will be going under the update
process as soon as I've ironed out some  niggles I'm getting with the solarPanelTariff.htm application.
